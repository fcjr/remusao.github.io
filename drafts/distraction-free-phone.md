3 years ago I read this article: [My year with a distraction-free iPhone](https://medium.com/time-dorks/my-year-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-and-how-to-start-your-own-experiment-6ff74a0e7a50). To be honest, even though I found the experiment interesting at the time, I think I was not ready to switch myself.


But now I ..., and it's not just an *experiment*, it's a way of life, a
different relationship with your devices and your online life. Even though there
are many ways this can be done, I think it's at least important to understand
the tradeoffs we make in this regard.
