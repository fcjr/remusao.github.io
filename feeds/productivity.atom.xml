This machine is shared between several people (a small team of 6 people). Before that, I used to code, run programs, do stuff on my local machine, now, everything is done on a remote server.
In this post I would like to give feedback about this way of working, why I wanted to tried this, what changed in the way a I work, what was bad, good, different, etc.
I would like to emphasis that this is not a why-you-should-do-it-kind of post, instead, I would be glad to know what you think about it, and what was your own experience, in case you also tried remote working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What changed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pros&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How it could be different&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;</summary><category term="cloud"></category><category term="work"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry></feed>
